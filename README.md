# elm-digitalclock

My first experiment with [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - a 12hr digital clock!

Perhaps this will turn into something amazing (unlikely).

## Installation

First follow [this guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html). 

Then clone repository and install node dependencies:
```
    git clone https://github.com/mooce/elm-digitalclock
    cd elm-digitalclock
    elm-package install
```

Now you can run this locally in your browser by running this command in terminal:
```
  elm-reactor
```
